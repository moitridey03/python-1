    "Tuples are data structures in programming languages that are similar to lists. Here are the key characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "1.\tOrdered: Like lists, tuples are ordered collections of elements. Each element in a tuple has a specific position or index.\n",
    "2.\tHeterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types. For example, a tuple can have a combination of integers, strings, and other data types.\n",
    "3.\tImmutable: One of the main characteristics of tuples is that they are immutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements or size. This immutability makes tuples different from lists, which are mutable.\n",
    "Here's a brief example in Python to illustrate the immutability of tuples:\n",
    "# Creating a tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 'hello', 3.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing elements\n",

    "# Attempting to modify a tuple will result in an error\n",
    "# Uncommenting the next line will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10\n",

    "In the example above, trying to modify an element of the tuple (my_tuple[0] = 10) would result in a TypeError because tuples are immutable.\n"

    "Tuples have a restricted number of methods compared to lists due to their immutability. Lists, being mutable, support a wider range of operations such as appending, removing, and modifying elements. Consequently, lists offer methods like append(), remove(), insert(), and extend(), among others, to facilitate these operations. The limited functionality of tuples aligns with their intended purpose of representing immutable sequences of elements. This design choice in Python reflects the principle of providing specialized tools for specific use cases, ensuring clarity and efficiency in programming."
